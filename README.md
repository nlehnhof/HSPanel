# HSPanel

Develop a Hess-Smith Panel Method

SET UP
1. Input Airfoil coordinates
2. Plot airfoil coordinates
3. Plot airfoil panels using the airfoil coordinates
4. Find midpoint-coordinates for each panel
5. Find distance from each panel to every other panel

MATH
6. Calculate influences - find how each panel vortex influences every other panel vortex
7. Input Boundary Conditions
8. Set up systems of equations (matrix) -- should have N + 1 equations where N = number of panels (one equation for every panel + 1 for Kutta condition)
9. Solve systems of equations
10. Plot results
